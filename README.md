# Flutter Web Codelab (pt. 2) - Flutter Web Apps / Using Riverpod

## Overview

Thank you for sticking around throughout this series of codelabs around Flutter Web.


### NOTE: THIS IS NOT A BEGINNER CODELAB

(If you're looking for more beginner content, please visit some of my other codelabs [here](https://romanjustcodes.web.app/#/workshops)). If you're up for the challenge, then proceed.

This is the second of a codelab series focused on Flutter Web. Follow [this link](https://romanejaquez.github.io/flutterweb-codelab-portfolio1) for part one of this series, where we learned how to set up our project and lay down some foundational items.

In Part 2, you will continue building the Flutter portfolio web app and learn the following:

- Build the navigation feature
- State Management using [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/)
- Create data repositories that feed data (mocked for now) into the app
- Create providers that hydrate the user interface accordingly
- Build out the rest of the feature pages for this web app
